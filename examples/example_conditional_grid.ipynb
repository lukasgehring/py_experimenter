Further explanation about the usage of `PyExperimenter` can be found in the [documentation](https://tornede.github.io/py_experimenter/usage.html). Here, we only define keyfields and resultfields and do not set the parameter values in the experiment configuration file as we will create the parameter grid programmatically."
